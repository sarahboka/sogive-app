            <h3>About SoGive</h3>
            <span>
                SoGive is an independent nonprofit that analyses charities to help donors find the best places to give. We produce ratings of charities based on how much impact they make.
                <br/><br/>
                We're hiring a Senior Dev with project & team management experience to help grow the technical side of our operations, and maximize our ability to most effectively help donors maximize their charitable impact. SoGive is still very much in a start-up phase of its growth. Due to this, there is tremendous potential for having a large impact on the organization, while also involving the risk and excitement of an early stage organization.
