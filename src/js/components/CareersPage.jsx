            <h2>Senior Dev / Team Lead</h2>
            <h3>About SoGive</h3>
            <span>
                SoGive is an independent nonprofit that analyses charities to help donors find the best places to give. We produce ratings of charities based on how much impact they make.
                <br/><br/>
                We're hiring a Senior Dev with project & team management experience to help grow the technical side of our operations, and maximize our ability to most effectively help donors maximize their charitable impact. SoGive is still very much in a start-up phase of its growth. Due to this, there is tremendous potential for having a large impact on the organization, while also involving the risk and excitement of an early stage organization.
                <br/><br/>
                Salary: Depending on skills and experience
                <br/><br/>
                Location: Remote. Our staff is located largely in the UK, Europe, and the U.S., though our volunteer network is truly global. We are flexible on location as long as we’re able to have routine chats as a team. The core team hours are: 3pm to 6pm UK time - any location is OK, as long as those hours work for you in your timezone.
                <br/><br/>
                Hours: Full-Time (flexible options available)

            <h2>Analyst / Senior Analyst</h2>
            <h3>About SoGive</h3>
            <span>
                SoGive is a volunteer-driven organisation which <b>analyses charities</b> and makes that analysis freely available on our website. Our mission is to help donors do more good with their donations.
                <br/><br/>
                Our analytical method involves applying what we call the <b>SoGive two-question method</b>, a charity analysis approach which focuses on cost-effectiveness.
                <br/><br/>
                Our approach has similarities with that followed by charity analysis organisations like GiveWell and Founders Pledge.
                <br/><br/>
                We differentiate by applying a rating to a <b>very broad range</b> of charities, covering almost all of the large charities in the UK, many small charities and several internationally. We aim to achieve strong brand recognition, at first in the UK.
                <br/><br/>
                We currently move over <b>£1m</b> pa, most of which comes from a very small number of major donors. We also provide some support to fundraising events. We plan to grow this donor base. Our growth plans include partnerships with other organisations moving material amounts of funds.
                <br/><br/>
                Our <b>key priorities</b> for the next 12 months are improving our website, continuing to expand our (already substantial) analysis of charities and further developing our analysis methodology, reaching more donors, and continuing to strengthen our team of volunteer analysts.
                <br/><br/>
                SoGive is still very much in a start-up phase of its growth. Due to this, there is tremendous potential for having a large impact on the organisation, while also involving the risk and excitement of an early stage organisation.
            </span>
            <hr/>
            <h3>The role: your responsibilities (Senior Analyst)</h3>
            <span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take senior-level ownership for part of SoGive’s analytical output. This includes: </li>
                    <li><ul>
                    <li>Overseeing or producing some in-depth reports on effective giving, specific charities and cause areas</li>
                    <li>Contributing to the “public information only” charity reviews (aka broad and shallow analysis), and contributing to the further development of our analytical methodology for these reviews</li>
                    <li>Overseeing the further development of our analytical methodology with regard to the in-depth analysis, and liaise with the Principal Analyst to ensure this is consistent with the methodology relating to “public information only” analysis</li>
                    <li>A university degree, 2nd className or higher, from a respected university. </li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>Have a strong handle on SoGive’s analytical methodology and writing style, and liaise with the rest of the team to ensure that the way the information is presented on the website strikes the right balance of conveying insights succinctly and providing the full detail around caveats and assumptions</li>
                    <li>Liaise with the members of the volunteer analyst team who are involved in your work (the volunteer team is currently c15 analysts spread across many countries and timezones</li>
                </ul>
                If employed at the level of Analyst, your responsibilities will be similar to that of the Senior Analyst, but with greater support and oversight being provided by the Principal Analyst.
            </span>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Some responsibilities yet to be shared out</h3>
            <span>
                The below lists out several areas of responsibility which will need to be covered by either you or the current Principal Analyst. This will be decided partly based on the preferences and aptitudes of the individuals in question.
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that meetings with key stakeholders function effectively, especially the charities being reviewed and the major donors that SoGive works with</li>
                    <li>Liaise with the wider team the SoGive Founder/CEO to ensure that the staffing of the SoGive analysis function is adequate</li>
                    <li>Overseeing and being actively involved in SoGive’s moral weights research, which may involve conducting primary research and getting it published</li>
                    <li>Ownership of the outward facing elements of the analysis; this means considering how the analysis relates to the front end. For example, when the analysis appears on the website, does it still communicate what should be communicated? How much can be communicated through website design elements, and how much will be communicated in writing?</li>
                    <li>Responding to news, e.g. if current events mean that analysis on the most effective donation opportunities would be useful, SoGive could conduct that analysis.</li>
                </ul>
