Name to be used,"The official name, usually as registered with the Charity Commission.","There's not a fixed taxonomy, but try to anticipate the things that people might search for if they are looking for charities like this",,,,The registration number with the Charity Commission of England & Wales,Does it accept donations from the public? E.g. certain trusts for specific donors wouldn't do this. Any entry in here *must* start with Yes or No,Add your name if you've contributed to this data collection!,"This is for when a charity has multiple projects and we've split the analysis up.

(so for example if it's a multinational group with a U.K. entity, then the answer would be ""Yes"")","Link to the charity's page on the charity commission website. Only relevant for those which are registered with the charity commission - or if it's a registered charity in Scotland show the relevant page on the OSCR website, and similarly for the charity commission of Northern Ireland",Source 1: URL - this is typically going to be the annual report from the charity commission website,Source 2: URL,Comments/more detail - e.g. page reference for the number of beneficiaries or anything that was particularly hard to find,"number, usually listed in the prose","units of impact; where there is a noun which would have to change to singular, indicate the singular in brackets; try to keep this to about 2 words, and certainly no more than 5 words long","Expand on the short version in a way that clarifies the short version. This could involve explaining more about what the short version means, and also indicating things like whether it's an average over lots of different projects or just refers to one project","Sometimes the accounts will refer to ""indirect beneficiaries"" - include those here.

Accounting guidelines encourage charities to show grant funds as ""income from charitable activities"", so the figures labelled as ""income from charitable activities"" in accounts are often not what we need. Reviewing the figures by looking at the notes to the accounts often provides the level of detail needed to judge this correctly. Looking for reason to believe that if this funding disappeared, the charity has the option to simply not do the activity any more.","How much of the ""cost"" quoted was spent on revenue generating trading/business of the charity. Doesn't include trading where the counterparty of the trade is a beneficiary of the charity (i.e. where the trading *is* part of the charitable work) - this would be income from charitable activities instead)","We deduct the money spent on trading and fundraising to find the money spent on the beneficiaries. The reason for this is just simplicity: if money spent fundraising and on trading just raised itself over again, it'd be the same as if it'd just sat in the bank that year, appearing neither on the cost nor income ledgers.",cost per beneficiary / output,cost per beneficiary / output,cost per beneficiary / output,cost per beneficiary / output,cost per beneficiary / output,cost per beneficiary / output,If the cost per beneficiary calclauted in the spreadsheet is an upper bound for the true cost say yes here otherwise leave blank,Explain here if any changes to the calc of cost per ben/output/outcome.

If there is no UK entity, enter zero, because there's zero income coming to a uk entity","Amount of reserves is usually stated in the ""wordy bit"" (c first half of the accounts)",Reserves as % of annual expenditure,"Source (ie which page number in the accounts) ; what is the target level of the reserves, and how does this compare. If you notice any risks such as underisked pension schemes or FX risk, then mention those here too",,"Where a charity has several projects, we may have to choose one as the representative project. For really big mega-charities, it may be necessary to have the ""representative"" row being an aggregate or ""average"" of all the projects",Is there enough data to include in the SoGive app? A judgement,"An indicator of the confidence we have in the data, especially the cost per impact",Why?,About one sentence long,About 2-3 paragraphs long,"This is the qualitative bit about what your donation achieves.
