				<span class="font-18 black-font">
					SoGive is an independent nonprofit that analyses charities to help donors find the best places to give. We produce ratings of charities based on how much impact they make.
					<br>
					<br>
					We're hiring a Senior Dev with project & team management experience to help grow the technical side of our operations, and maximize our ability to most effectively help donors maximize their charitable impact. SoGive is still very much in a start-up phase of its growth. Due to this, there is tremendous potential for having a large impact on the organization, while also involving the risk and excitement of an early stage organization.

					Salary: Depending on skills and experience

					Location: Remote. Our staff is located largely in the UK, Europe, and the U.S., though our volunteer network is truly global. We are flexible on location as long as we're able to have routine chats as a team. The core team hours are: 3pm to 6pm UK time - any location is OK, as long as those hours work for you in your timezone.

				<H2>Director of SoGive</H2>
				<H3>About SoGive</H3>
				<span class="font-18 black-font">
					SoGive is a volunteer-driven organisation which <b>analyses charities</b> and makes that analysis freely available on our website. Our mission is to help donors do more good with their donations.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our analytical method involves applying what we call the <b>SoGive two-question method</b>, a charity analysis approach which focuses on cost-effectiveness.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our approach has similarities with that followed by charity analysis organisations like GiveWell and Founders Pledge.
					<br>
					<br>
					We differentiate by applying a rating to a <b>very broad range</b> of charities, covering almost all of the large charities in the UK, many small charities and several internationally.
					<br>
					<br>
					We currently move over <b>Â£1m</b> pa, most of which comes from a very small number of major donors. We also provide some support to fundraising events. We plan to grow this donor base.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our <b>key priorities</b> for the next 12 months are transforming our website, continuing to expand our (already substantial) analysis of charities, reaching more donors, and continuing to strengthen our team of volunteer analysts.

						</li>
						<li>
							Oversee analysis work, including SoGive's broad and shallow charity analysis, SoGive's in-depth charity/intervention/cause area analysis, and SoGive's moral weights analysis. Strengthen existing processes for ensuring consistency of analysis quality, writing style, and how the information is presented on the SoGive website
						</li>
						<li>
							Overseeing the analysis work also involves overseeing the SoGive charity analysis volunteer team; currently c15 volunteers working 1 day per week
						</li>
						<li>
							Maintain relationships with the handful of major donors and partner organisations whose donations are influenced by SoGive's analysis; ensure that donations made achieve excellent impact to the maximum extent possible

						<li>
							Maintain relationships with other charity analysis organisations
						</li>
						<li>
							Oversee outreach work, including oversight of digital marketing work, email outreach, and PR
