<h3><a href="#6-charges" id="6-charges">6. Charges</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>SoGive reserves the right at any time to modify the Service, including the fee basis for services.</li>
<li>Prices of all Services are subject to change upon 30 days' notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the SoGive Site (SoGive.org).

</ol>
<ul>
<li>At our discretion, payment may be required either upfront or in-arrears</li>

<li>Where payments are late or short, we may cancel or restrict your access to any or all of our services</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Prices of all Services to paying customers are subject to change upon 30 days' notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the SoGive Site (sogive.org). SoGive shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="#7-processing-of-donations-and-gift-aid" id="7-processing-of-donations-and-gift-aid">7. Processing of donations and Gift Aid</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>It is upto SoGive whether or not to include a charity or similar body.</li>
<li>SoGive enables charities to claim Gift Aid by gathering the Gift Aid declarations necessary to make this happen. SoGive then passes this information on to the charities to enable them to claim Gift Aid. Charities must be registered with the Charity Commission or exempt from registration for SoGive to pass on this information. SoGive may also feature certain not-for-profit and other organisations, which are not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. Such organisations are indicated on the SoGive site as not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. Donations to any of these Causes are not tax deductible.</li>
<li>SoGive also runs a &quot;non member charity&quot; service. This means SoGive may also feature on our Website charities even if they are not one of our member charities.</li>
<li>When SoGive sends a donation to a non member charity, SoGive will send the non member charity the donation plus the Gift Aid declaration information to enable them to claim Gift Aid. If the non member charity accepts the donation and receives the Gift Aid declaration information an agreement will be formed with SoGive. If they do not accept the cheque or the Gift Aid declaration information, they will not enter into any agreement with SoGive and the donation will not be processed. It may take up to six months from when SoGive passes your donation on to the charity to confirm that the donation will not be processed. If the non member charity refuses the donation, or SoGive is unable to make payment, or doesn't feel it is appropriate to pass on a donation (for example, if a charity has been de-registered by the Charity Commission or has a sanction listed against them) then SoGive will contact you so as to return the donation to you. If SoGive is unable to contact you then SoGive will select an appropriate alternative charity to pass the donation to.</li>
<li>SoGive does not provide tax advice and must not be used for tax guidance. Please use a qualified professional for tax matters.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="#8-indemnity" id="8-indemnity">8. Indemnity</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach by you of any provision of these Terms of Service, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these Terms of Service</li>
<li>You understand and agree that SoGive shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if SoGive has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from:
